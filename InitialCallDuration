/*
Initial Call Duration
Redfin helps clients to find agents. Each client will have a unique request_id and each request_id has several calls. 
For each request_id, the first call is an “initial call” and all the following calls are “update calls”. 
What's the average call duration for all initial calls?
*/

CODE:

import pandas as pd

first_call = redfin_call_tracking.groupby(['request_id'])['id'].min()
result = redfin_call_tracking[redfin_call_tracking['id'].isin(first_call)]['call_duration'].mean()
